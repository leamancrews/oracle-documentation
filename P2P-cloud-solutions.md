# P2P Automation With Oracle Cloud Solutions
The Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process starts with the requisitioning of goods and services and ends with processing payments to suppliers. But a fully integrated P2P system is more than that. P2P is an efficient and effective solution incorporating touchless automation to reduce errors and improve your company’s bottom line.

More than 25% of the small and midsize businesses that responded to a recent Paystream Advisors survey are evaluating integrated P2P solutions. Fifteen percent of the respondents are already using a P2P solution or are in the process of implementing one.

## Usability drives user adoption
User adoption is critical to the success of any P2P solution. Next-generation technology significantly improves the antiquated practice of navigating from the eProcurement system, to hosted catalogs, to the varying degrees of quality in punchout sites just to complete a requisition.

A next-generation platform should embrace a single, searchable interface and the consumer-like online shopping experience users crave. Instead of the disjointed experience between internally hosted catalogs and third-party websites, shoppers should be able to quickly find, compare and purchase across multiple suppliers in one interface. Because of this approach to usability, next-generation P2P requires little to no training but returns. 

## Transparent supplier relationships eliminate communication barriers
Suppliers want transparent relationships with their customers. The more they know, the better. The best P2P solutions eliminate barriers to entry, enhance visibility into the partnership between suppliers and buyers, and reduce business costs.

Because suppliers are bombarded with B2B integration requirements from their customers and prospects, P2P enablement needs to be packaged in a way that is easily understood and consumed by the supplier. Suppliers are more willing to comply when they know enablement is simpler, visibility into the account is holistic, and there is ultimately quantifiable savings.

## Spend analytics gives you more control

Do you have the ability to break out and analyze spending across all categories? How about tracking savings and budgets within each cost center? P2P spend analytics should give you insight into and control over both.

With access to real-time strategic data across the entire buying landscape, department heads have the visibility to drive better spending decisions and unlock savings opportunities. In turn, procurement and finance in particular, have a better sense of where company money is being spent and how savings might be generated.

## Autoamtion makes you more efficient

The automation of workflows in next-generation P2P solutions minimizes time spent on manual processes and can even make existing automated processes more effective.

The most common problem area for the global enterprise is around invoicing. Typically, invoice processing is manually reviewed and approved. This process is time-consuming and can result in missed early payment discounts or late payment penalties.

By configuring the workflows appropriately, you can eliminate the need for manual rerouting of approval requests, achieve faster cycle times, increase purchase order processing, shorten supplier lead times, and quickly track and approve exceptions. These workflows help to beter manage and allocate headcount accordingly. 

## Contact compliance saves money

Operational efficiency is crucial to successful procurement processes. And procurement can’t operate without contracts. Effective contract processes and transparent spending in next-generation P2P solutions enable organizations to achieve contract compliance while driving savings through efficient expenditure.

## The cloud facet

However, just implementing an ERP system would not provide that simple integrated view. Multiple source systems and the associated data integration challenges were still a factor. Data enrichment was needed.

The cloud-based solutions can be implemented with low upfront costs for faster ROI. Designed to enable finance teams to streamline P2P while improving efficiency through collaboration and standardization, these solutions are offered in flexible packages to meet a company’s specific business needs.

Companies can choose from various modules, a library of pre-built reports, and standard role-based security mapped to their needs. And to accelerate adoption, Oracle provides embedded help to shorten the learning curve and ensure users become productive quickly.
