# Best Practices in HCM : A Guide to Total Rewards
Today's market leaders are developing performance-driven rewards
programs to recruit and retain top-notch employees. They use variable pay mechanisms to match business performance with employee performance as part of a "total rewards" program. Stock options, advanced degree programs, vacation time, and periodic bonuses all play a role in these variable or "differentiated" compensation plans.

Variable compensation programs blend monetary and non-monetary rewards based on the needs of each segment of the workforce. Employees participate in corporate success. When a company has lower-than-expected profits, variable compensation budgets are reduced. The bonus pool grows when the company's profits exceed targets, and employees reap the benefits.
The best rewards programs rely on Human Capital Management (HCM) technology to automate various technical, administrative, and analytic tasks, empowering HR professionals to create flexible compensation plans that augment traditional merit increases and bonuses. This paper offers guidance for creating a total rewards program and describes the essential attributes of a robust HCM platform.
## SEGMENTING THE WORKFORCE
HCM technology can help you segment your employee base and allocate dollars where they will have the best return. For example, you might pull various analytics from staffing and learning applications to identify jobs and skill sets that are most crucial and in the shortest supply, then adjust the compensation for those roles to pay market-based premiums. Identify additional variation based on performance within those job families and skill sets. When designing performance measures within a workforce segment, consider non-financial metrics for gauging employee performance, such as customer satisfaction scores and customer retention statistics. 

For example, one large hospitality company segments its customer-facing employees and rewards them for displaying an upbeat, positive attitude. This firm, known for its famous casino brand, increased customer satisfaction through rigorous data analytics and careful segmentation, with rewards designed for its workforce. There are many reasons to segment employee populations—not just for monetary rewards. For example, one large medical center in the Midwestern United States successfully increased participation in its retirement program after research revealed that African Americans were under-enrolled relative to other segments. This organization rectified the situation by creating targeted financial seminars for African-American employees increasing signup in the retirement program. Companies that utilize consistent, integrated talent management platforms can best support these segmentation efforts.
## CREATING A FLEXIBLE COMPENSATION PLAN WITH DIFFERENTIATED BENEFITS
Merit planning and base-salary planning follow an annual cycle. Pay raises for U.S. employees are expected to hold steady at 3% in 2017, according to a survey by Willis Towers Watson. This leaves little room for segmentation and differentiation. It's not very meaningful to give a 3.2
percent increase for high performers and a 2.8 percent increase for average performers. 

That's why so many companies have added variable compensation to their total rewards packages. For example,
you might take a portion of your budget, which generally would have been spread thinly throughout salary increases for many employees, and redirect that money to provide bonuses to employees who
possess critical skill sets. This enables you to reward people based on how they help your company or division fulfill its goals and objectives.
Survey your employees to determine what they want and prioritize the rewards accordingly. For example, you might let employees choose among various equity selections, such as stock options and
a cash-based bonus plan, for up to $10,000 of their total compensation package. 

A flexible compensation plan also features a cafeteria plan that includes vacation time, medical procedures, retirement programs, or stock option plans. One large retailer improved cash flow opportunities for
store associates by replacing stock options with a profit-sharing plan after segmented research
showed that this population preferred immediate cash to potential equity growth.
It's also essential to comply with industry standards, customs, and regulations. In highly regulated industries such as banking, there are increasingly strict rules about the type and sizes of bonuses that
can be offered, as well as a "claw-back" option to recollect awards for long-term performance.
## SIZING UP THE PROBLEM: GROWING COMPLEXITY
Variable compensation plans and total rewards programs hold tremendous promise for engaging, motivating, and retaining the workforce. However, as organizations adopt a culture of performance aligned with corporate goals, the compensation scenarios invariably become more complex.
Compensation professionals must look at multiple types of measures for various roles in the company,
factoring in commensurate incentives across geographic and regulatory boundaries. In large organizations, the process is so complex it is common to find "leakage" in compensation. For example,
by the time some businesses get their compensation budgets approved, the compensation pools do
not reflect the reality of the staff currently in place. This can result in:
• Allocating limited compensation budgets to employees who leave soon after the compensation cycle is complete
• Managers "gaming" the system to keep their compensation budgets the same even after they have lost staff
• Human error in data entry and calculations in spreadsheets
• Unnecessary waste of HR and administrative resources
• It's not easy to keep up with the incentive parameters and regulatory requirements using manual
processes and spreadsheets. That's why astute organizations acquire a technology platform that
helps them design, administer, and update their variable compensation programs.

### USING HCM TECHNOLOGY TO AUTOMATE COMPENSATION TASKS
Given the extraordinary complexity of global compensation plans, having a flexible technology platform is essential. Your HCM platform should help automate compensation analysis, design, and administration. For example, it should be easy for HR to review how compensation rules are created, edited, and implemented. It should also allow HR pros to develop highly differentiated pay.
