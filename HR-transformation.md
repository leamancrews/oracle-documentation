# 10 Best Practices to Drive HR Transformation
In the age of the 4th Industrial revolution, HR needs to transform itself into
a digital strategic partner However, for many HR professionals, this may
remain more of an aspiration than a reality.
When LACE Partners recently conducted interviews with senior HR practitioners
from leading global businesses, they spoke of wanting to stop “pandering to line
managers, reacting to business whims and working in silos” and start
“understanding the critical people drivers”.1 All the HRDs spoke of the need for
an increased focus on people data to provide greater insight into what’s
happening, diagnosing trends and making evidence-based decisions.
But many are either not aware of this challenge, have the criteria for success to
implement, or don’t yet have the right technology in place to do so. A recent
CIPD survey found that just over half (54 per cent) of organisations have access
to people data and analytics and only half (52 per cent) of HR practitioners
stated that their organisation uses people data to tackle business problems. It
comes as no surprise, then, that one Chief People Officer told LACE that HR “will
become an endangered species unless we up our game fast.”
HR directors and professionals are, however, perfectly positioned to help their
departments, leadership teams and organizations to change and adapt to a
digital world and leverage data. At Oracle, we find that the most successful and
impactful HR departments are the ones that have embraced the digital
revolution, using the very latest HCM technology to truly understand both their
data and their people. As a consequence, these benefits are reflected in the
business’ bottom line.

Our customers report a productivity increase of 79 per cent with Oracle HCM
Cloud. Through self-service, customers have reduced HR staff time spent on
routine activities by 34 per cent (i.e. no more “pandering to line managers” or
“reacting to business whims”!), and empowering the organisation to be
proactive to trends and insights enabled through easy to digest analytics on
mobile devices. Our customers have also been able to enhance employee
engagement by 15 per cent through a more effective performance and goal
management process, aligning employee goals with their organization’s
strategy and vision.
## Top 10 HR Transformation Practices
Based on feedback from Oracle HCM
customers participating in our Value Realization Program and our Account
Directors, we identified 10 best practices, where we see organisations optimise
the return on their HCM deployment when supporting companies drive their HR
transformations:

1. Simplify and standardise your environment as much as possible
before embarking on digital transformation. All customers interviewed
eliminated customizations.
2. Build expertise in creating a culture of change management; including
creation and distribution of “super users” to drive adoption
3. Use innovative communication and training methods such as
collaboration platforms, e-learning systems, gamification, challenges
and pop-up stands to disseminate key information and engage
employees.
4. Secure and executive mandate is maintained for the duration of the
project and not just until launch. Customers interviewed had an
influential sponsor or champion, typically the line executive and/or the
CEO.
5. Create a performance-driven culture that rewards employees for their
contributions. See what employees are working on, track their
performance on appropriate metrics, and tie employee compensation to
contributions.
6. Invest in reporting and analytics. Customers interviewed stressed on
the need to provide managers with a global holistic view of the
workforce for improved decision making. Within policy provides clear
and transparent reports which are easily accessible on multiple
deceives. Managers should have the skills and be empowered with team
analytics to make local decisions.
7. Make knowledge and people accessible with a single business-
sponsored location for employee profiles and enterprise knowledge.
8. HR needs to own the change process and associated system
deployment. It’s important to link policy, process, system deployment
and associated change impact against business benefit.
9. Agile decision making. Transformation projects move at speed and its
essential that the team is empowered to make quick decisions to stay
on track.
10. Have internal resources in place before the consultants leave. Making
sure there has been investments for internal resources to continue
being successful after implementation.
